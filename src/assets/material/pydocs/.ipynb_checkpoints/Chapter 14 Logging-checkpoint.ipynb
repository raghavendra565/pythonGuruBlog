    "\n",
    "It is very important to record the activies of a software system. This process is called logging. We can achieve this by printing a message on console when a significant event happening in the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples are, showing the status of success or failure of a database connectivity, or a network event or a file access etc. This helps us in tracking the system health, resource utilization at an instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a software system crashes, first thing every developer does is 'looking at logs of the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Printing logs on a console doesn't persist in memory once machine is shutdown. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most frequently logs are written on permenent storage devices as files. File logging is very popular in the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple printing statments are prefered when programs are smaller. This approache is not suggested when running complex projects and programs running in the background. Hence File logging is prefered over console logging. There are other logging mediums used, based on project requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples \n",
    "- database logging - logging events in any database\n",
    "- SMTP logging - logs are sent through emails\n",
    "- Network logging - Logs are sent to sockets etc\n",
    "\n",
    "In file logging messages are appended to a file during program running to know the state and status of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally logs are appended with different types of criticality levels. So that, based on the level we can segregate process, filter and analyze and identify criticality of the issues and take an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are different types of levels for logging message, based on the requirement we can set the log levels\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>DEBUG:</b> This can be used to know intermediate results of some operation or task and verify or evaluate the results. For eg., results of adding two lists or to know contents of dict. Numeric value for this level is 10\n",
    "- <b>INFO:</b> This is just to know the information or progress of a task or program. In following cases it can be used. For eg., service started successfully, successful login Numeric value for this level is 20\n",
    "- <b>WARNING:</b> These are soft messages and no blockage in executing the code. Can be used for wrong password. Numeric value for this level is 30\n",
    "- <b>ERROR:</b> We can use this level if there are any logical errors in code and environment related errors while setup. For eg., try to open file and failed, value error when converting string to int or vice versa Numeric value for this level is 40\n",
    "- <b>CRITICAL:</b> This level having the highest priority. This can be used for memory exceptions or index error. Numeric value for this level is 50\n",
    "\n",
    "*Numeric value is just to define its priority(criticality or significance) based on the number. Based on the level set the specific level messages are logged. If the level set to DEBUG all types of messages are logged into file.\n",
